# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This README will provide an overview of the HTML and CSS files that make up this site and explain their functionalities.

## HTML

The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure and content of the portfolio website. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

### Structure

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Specifies the HTML version and document type.
- `<html lang="en">`: Defines the document's root element with the language attribute set to English.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Sets the character encoding to UTF-8.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Configures the viewport for responsive design.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the page.
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="Assets/style.css">`: Links the CSS stylesheet to the HTML document.
- `<body>`: Represents the content of the HTML document.

### Sections

- **Navbar (`<nav>`)**: Displays the navigation links to different sections of the website.
- **Hero Section (`<section class="hero-section">`)**: Introduces the website owner and provides a brief overview.
- **Projects Section**: Showcases various projects with links to their respective pages or demos.
- **Contact Section**: Provides contact information and links to the owner's GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
- **Footer**: Displays copyright information.

## CSS

The CSS file (`style.css`) styles the HTML elements to enhance the visual presentation and layout of the website. Here's an overview of its key styles:

### General Styling

- Defines styles for the `body`, `nav`, `header`, `ul`, `li`, `a`, and `footer` elements.
- Sets the font family, background colors, margins, paddings, and box-sizing.

### Hero Section Styling

- Styles the hero section (`hero-section`) with specific layout properties such as flexbox.
- Defines styles for text (`<h2>`) and images within the hero section.
- Sets background colors and margins.

### Project Section Styling

- Uses flexbox to create a responsive grid layout for project boxes (`<div class="box">`).
- Defines styles for project images, links, and container (`<div class="container">`).

### Contact Section Styling

- Styles the contact section (`<section id="contact" class="contact">`) with specific margin and text-align properties.
- Defines styles for contact information (`<ul>`) and links.

### Media Queries

- Includes media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes, ensuring responsiveness.
